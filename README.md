# Exam-Papers
Exam style questions on a variety of topics and varying levels of stoopid. Can be used to troll unsuspecting Year 12 ATAR students or annoy teachers. <br>
Not all the theory questions are possible, but all the calculation questions should be solveable and can be done as legitimate practice. They might be a little harder than what your used to though. <br>
